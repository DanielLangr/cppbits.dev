<p><strong>Why should anyone want to read another C&#43;&#43; learning material</strong> when there are so many of them out there, both printed and online? Because, in my opinion, they generally <strong>do not provide the true understanding of C&#43;&#43;</strong>. For example, how can anyone understand C&#43;&#43; without learning about the <em>as-if rule</em> and the <em>observable behavior concept</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typical learning texts teach us how to use in C&#43;&#43; all those abstranction mechanisms such as functions, classes, or polymorphism, they teach us how to write data to a file or how to sort an array. But these mechanisms and functionalities are provided by many other programming languages as well. <strong>So why should we actually use C&#43;&#43; and what is so unique about it?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, the highest motivation for using C&#43;&#43; is <strong>performance and efficiency</strong>. Performance in terms of fast programs and efficiencny in terms of minimizing required system resources, such as CPU runtime or the amount of allocated memory. Without the need of performance and efficiency, one would likely not use C&#43;&#43; since it is not an easy language. In fact, <strong>C&#43;&#43; is hard</strong>. Forget about learning it in 21 days. Yes, you can learn how to write a program with some desired functionality (which you should likely learn how to implement much easier with Python). But to learn how to write code with respect to maximizing performance and efficiency usually requires much more knowledge and insight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For illustration, let us look at a question commonly asked students or job applicants: <strong>“Where are function local variables stored?”</strong> A typical meaning of this question is actually <em>“Where are stored function local variables with automatic storage duration when the function is executed at runtime”</em>? A typical answer is: <strong>“On the stack.”</strong> Even the books tell us that:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a typical implementation, automatic objects are allocated on the stack&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a function is called, its automatic variables are added to the stack&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, <strong>this answer is incorrect</strong>. Moreover, <strong>the question itself is wrong</strong> since it does not make any sense. To understand, please, read the very first post of this tutorial&#8230;&#8203;</p>
