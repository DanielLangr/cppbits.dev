These are some articles...

I work as a research assistant professor at the Faculty of Information Technology of the Czech Technical University in Prague, where I participate in both research and teaching activities. {cpp} has been with me for more than 25 years. During those 25 years, {cpp} has become both my work and my hobby. I use it mostly for developing massively-parallel programs intended to be run on large supercomputers.
